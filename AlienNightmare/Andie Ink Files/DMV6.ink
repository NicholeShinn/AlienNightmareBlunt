You: All right, what are you here for?

    Patron: Five minutes ago. 
    You: Huh? 
    Patron: Yeah. Just got the confirmation email and everything. 
    You: How much are they paying you? 
    Patron: Isn't talking about that illegal? 
    You: That's what they want you to think. 
    Patron: Uh...
    You: It's my boss I'll be mad at, not you. 
    Patron: ...They pay me 80k a year. 
    You: Shit, I'm getting underpaid. 
    Patron: Sorry. 
    You: Like I said, not your fault.

    Patron: Yeah. Here. 
    You: Oh, huh, you weren't kidding. 
    You: Would have appreciated a heads up from the boss at least... 
    Patron: This is the DMV. What did you expect? 
    You: Yeah, good point. I assume they didn't train you either? 
    Patron: Nope. They said I could figure it out as I went. 
    You: Well, these systems are so criminally babyproofed that I feel like I'm losing brain cells when I work here. 
    Patron: Ah. 
    You: Yeah.

You: That sounds... very nice, actually. Thanks. 
Patron: Have a good one.
You: You too.
