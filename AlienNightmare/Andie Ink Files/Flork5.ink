Flork: Oh boy, fried ice cubes. My favorite. 
Streamer: Wait, aren’t you supposed to, uh…
Streamer: NOT put ice cubes in the deep fryer? 
Flork: Well, it didn’t turn out too bad last time!

    Flork: Oh, the kitchen exploded. 
    Flork: Luckily, I only ended up with second-degree burns. 
    Streamer: ONLY second degree burns???
    Flork: Yeah. Heals up in no time. 
    Streamer: I shudder to think what happens to you on the regular for you to see that as “no time”.

    Flork: Oh, I do this every Thanksgiving. 
    Flork: Kind of like how people do deep fried turkey. 
    Streamer: …I don’t suppose those turn out too well either. 
    Flork: Oh, no, definitely not. When my uncle made it it was still raw on the inside! 
    Flork: Shame we couldn’t be too harsh on him for it. He ended up in the hospital. 
    Streamer: Oh.

Flork: Well, I must be off. I hear my frying oil boiling. 
Streamer: Uh… good luck. I think.
